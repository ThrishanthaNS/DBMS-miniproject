# Quick Test Guide for Payment Integration

## Prerequisites
1. ‚úÖ Backend running on http://localhost:8000
2. ‚úÖ Frontend running on http://localhost:3000
3. ‚úÖ MySQL database connected and tables created

## Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Verify Backend Endpoints
Open your browser and check:
- http://localhost:8000/api/payments (should return [] if no payments exist)
- http://localhost:8000/docs (FastAPI Swagger docs - you should see the payment endpoints)

### Step 2: Prepare Test Data
Before recording a payment, you need:

1. **Create a Guest:**
   - Go to "üë• Guests" tab
   - Click "+ Add New Guest"
   - Fill in: Name, Phone Number
   - Submit

2. **Create a Room:**
   - Go to "üè† Rooms" tab
   - Click "+ Add New Room"
   - Fill in: Room Number (e.g., "101"), Type (e.g., "Single"), Monthly Rent (e.g., "5000")
   - Submit

3. **Create a Booking:**
   - Go to "üìã Bookings" tab
   - Click "+ Create New Booking"
   - Select the guest and room you just created
   - Set check-in date
   - Submit

### Step 3: Record a Payment

1. Go to "üí∞ Payments" tab
2. Click "+ Record Payment"
3. Select the booking from dropdown (should show: "Booking #X - [Guest Name] - Room [Room Number]")
4. Enter amount (e.g., 5000)
5. Select payment date (default is today)
6. Choose payment method (Cash/UPI/Card/Bank Transfer)
7. Add remarks (optional, e.g., "First month rent")
8. Click "Record Payment"

### Step 4: Verify Payment

You should see:
- Success alert: "Payment recorded successfully!"
- Payment appears in the table below
- Statistics cards update:
  - Total Payments count increases
  - Total Amount shows the sum
  - This Month count increases

### Step 5: Check Database (Optional)

Run this SQL query in your MySQL database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Payments;
```

You should see your payment record with:
- payment_id
- booking_id
- amount_paid
- payment_date
- payment_method
- remarks
- created_at

## Expected Results

### Payment Table Columns:
1. Payment ID - Auto-generated
2. Booking Info - Shows "Guest Name - Room Number"
3. Amount Paid - Shows ‚Çπ formatted amount
4. Payment Date - Date when payment was made
5. Payment Method - Badge showing Cash/UPI/Card/Bank Transfer
6. Remarks - Your notes (or "-" if empty)
7. Recorded At - Timestamp when record was created

### Statistics Cards:
- **Total Payments**: Count of all payments
- **Total Amount**: Sum of all amount_paid values
- **This Month**: Count of payments in current month

## Troubleshooting

### If you get errors:

1. **"Failed to fetch data"**
   - Check if backend is running
   - Check browser console for CORS errors
   - Verify database connection

2. **"Booking with id X not found"**
   - Make sure you created a booking first
   - Check that the booking status is "Active"

3. **"Failed to create payment"**
   - Check that all required fields are filled
   - Verify amount is greater than 0
   - Check backend terminal for error messages

4. **Empty dropdown for bookings**
   - You need to create at least one active booking first
   - Go to Bookings tab and create a booking

## API Testing (Alternative Method)

You can also test using curl or Postman:

```bash
# Get all payments
curl http://localhost:8000/api/payments

# Create a payment
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "booking_id": 1,
    "amount_paid": 5000.00,
    "payment_date": "2025-10-16",
    "payment_method": "UPI",
    "remarks": "Test payment"
  }'
```

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Payment form opens and shows active bookings
‚úÖ Payment is recorded without errors
‚úÖ Payment appears in the table immediately
‚úÖ Statistics update correctly
‚úÖ Booking info shows guest and room details
‚úÖ Payment method badge is colored correctly

## Next Actions

Once payments are working, you can:
1. Record multiple payments for different bookings
2. Test different payment methods
3. View payment history over time
4. Calculate total revenue
5. Track payments per guest or room
