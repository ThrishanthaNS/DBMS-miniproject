# Payment Integration - Implementation Summary

## Backend Changes (FastAPI)

### 1. Added Payment Enum
```python
class PaymentMethod(str, Enum):
    CASH = 'Cash'
    UPI = 'UPI'

```

### 2. Added Payment Models
```python
class PaymentBase(BaseModel):
    booking_id: int
    amount_paid: Decimal
    payment_date: date
    payment_method: PaymentMethod
    remarks: Optional[str] = None

class PaymentCreate(PaymentBase):
    pass

class Payment(PaymentBase):
    payment_id: int
    created_at: datetime
```

## Database Table Used

The Payments table structure (already exists in your database):
```sql
CREATE TABLE Payments (
    payment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id INT NOT NULL,
    amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    payment_method ENUM('Cash', 'UPI', 'Card', 'Bank Transfer') NOT NULL,
    remarks VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (booking_id) REFERENCES Bookings(booking_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Testing the Integration

1. Make sure the backend is running on http://localhost:8000
2. Make sure the frontend is running on http://localhost:3000
3. Create some guests and rooms if you haven't already
4. Create at least one active booking
5. Go to the Payments section
6. Record a payment for an active booking
7. View the payment in the payment history table

## API Examples
