# Maintenance Requests Integration - Implementation Summary

## Backend Changes (FastAPI)

### 1. Added Maintenance Status Enum
```python
class MaintenanceStatus(str, Enum):
    PENDING = 'Pending'
    IN_PROGRESS = 'In Progress'
    RESOLVED = 'Resolved'
```

### 2. Added Maintenance Request Models
```python
class MaintenanceRequestBase(BaseModel):
    room_id: int
    guest_id: Optional[int] = None
    issue_description: str
    reported_date: date
    status: MaintenanceStatus = MaintenanceStatus.PENDING
    resolved_date: Optional[date] = None

class MaintenanceRequestCreate(MaintenanceRequestBase):
    pass

class MaintenanceRequest(MaintenanceRequestBase):
    request_id: int
```

### 3. Added Maintenance Request Endpoints

#### GET /api/maintenance
- Fetches all maintenance requests
- Returns requests sorted by reported date (descending)
- Response: List[MaintenanceRequest]

#### POST /api/maintenance
- Creates a new maintenance request
- Validates that the room exists
- Validates that the guest exists (if guest_id is provided)
- Fields:
  - room_id (required)

  - issue_description (required)
  - reported_date (required)

#### PATCH /api/maintenance/{request_id}
- Updates the status of a maintenance request
- Query parameters:

## How to Use

### Creating a Maintenance Request:
1. Go to the "üîß Maintenance" section
2. Click "+ Create Request"
3. Select a room (required)
4. Select a guest (optional - who reported the issue)
5. Enter detailed issue description
6. Set reported date (defaults to today)
7. Choose initial status (usually Pending)
8. Click "Create Request"

### Updating Request Status:
1. Find the request in the table
2. Click **"Start"** to move from Pending to In Progress
3. Click **"Resolve"** to mark as Resolved
4. Resolved date is automatically set when marked as resolved

### Viewing Maintenance History:
- All requests are displayed in the table
- Sorted by most recent first
- Statistics show breakdown by status
- Resolved requests show the resolution date

## Database Table Used

The MaintenanceRequests table structure (already exists in your database):
```sql
CREATE TABLE MaintenanceRequests (
    request_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id INT NOT NULL,
    guest_id INT,
    issue_description TEXT NOT NULL,
    reported_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT (CURRENT_DATE),
    status ENUM('Pending', 'In Progress', 'Resolved') DEFAULT 'Pending',
    resolved_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES Rooms(room_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (guest_id) REFERENCES Guests(guest_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

## Testing the Integration

1. Make sure the backend is running on http://localhost:8000
2. Make sure the frontend is running on http://localhost:3000
3. Create some rooms if you haven't already
4. Optionally create guests
5. Go to the Maintenance section
6. Create a maintenance request for a room
7. Update the status using the action buttons
8. View the updated status and resolved date

## API Examples

### Get All Maintenance Requests
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/maintenance
```

### Create a Maintenance Request
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/maintenance
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "room_id": 1,
  "guest_id": 2,
  "issue_description": "Air conditioner not working properly",
  "reported_date": "2025-10-16",
  "status": "Pending"
}
```

### Update Request Status
```
PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/maintenance/1?status=In Progress
```

```
PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/maintenance/1?status=Resolved&resolved_date=2025-10-16
```

## Workflow Example

1. **Guest reports issue**: Staff creates a request (Status: Pending)
2. **Maintenance starts work**: Staff clicks "Start" button (Status: In Progress)
3. **Issue is fixed**: Staff clicks "Resolve" button (Status: Resolved, resolved_date set)

## Use Cases
